# Responsive-Website
My first project, 
My fully responsive website, I worked on this while learning the basics of the mark up languages and JS. I kickstarted my coding journey from this project.

I have been following a course on Udemy and I thought that it'd be good to learn how ot use Git and Github, which I am still in the midst of doing...
HTML, CSS and some JS in this project, it's the first time ever touching these mark up languages and any programming languages at all. 

This repo consists of my index.html, several pages of css; seperated (Style, General, Media Queries). 

I'm learning github and trying to connect myself to the wonderful world of programming, 
As this is my first project, would love for tips and help from anyone!
